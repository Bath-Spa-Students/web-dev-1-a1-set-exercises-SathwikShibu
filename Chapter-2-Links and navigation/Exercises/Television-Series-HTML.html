        Po, now as the Dragon Warrior, helps his adoptive father, Mr. Ping, and biological father Li Shan, to open their new restaurant as Master Shifu arrives to tell him that he must advance and become the spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace. This means Po can no longer be the Dragon Warrior and must find a suitable candidate to take his place.

        Po struggles to choose the right candidate, but then he catches a fox bandit named Zhen trying to steal ancient weapons. He sends her to prison, but he soon learns that Tai Lung has returned and destroyed an entire village. Zhen reveals that Tai Lung's return was masqueraded by the Chameleon, a powerful sorceress who can shape-shift into any animal she wants.
        
        Po heads to Juniper City with Zhen to take down the Chameleon. However, they are arrested and eventually escape to the Den of Thieves. There, Po and Zhen head to the Chameleon's lair, but it is revealed that Zhen has been working for the Chameleon all along and betrays Po. She gives the Chameleon Po's staff, which has the power to bridge the gap through the Spirit Realm. The Chameleon uses the staff to summon every martial arts master to steal their kung fu, including Tai Lung, Lord Shen and General Kai.
        
        Zhen realizes her mistake and decides to leave the Chameleon for good. Po reunites with his fathers, who encourage him to stop the Chameleon. He reunites with Zhen, but they get into a duel after she tries to stop him from approaching the enemy. Zhen realizes that he has made his decision and bids him farewell before Po faces the Chameleon.
        
        Zhen convinces the Den of Thieves to help her rescue Po. Meanwhile, Tai Lung learns that Po has lost the Staff of Wisdom and loses faith in him. As the villagers battled the Chameleon's lizard army, Po tries to fight the Chameleon but gets overwhelmed. Zhen intervenes, but the Chameleon turns into a horrifying Chimaera of several of the masters, and the trio fight all over the room. Zhen is initially overpowered and stays. The Chameleon then turns into a Po clone, fights Po and soon traps him in a cage.
        
        Putting his trust in Zhen, Po gives Zhen the Staff of Wisdom, with which she summons a majestic dragon of Yin and Yang, which sends the Chameleon crashing into a wall. Po, who was only pretending to be trapped, defeats the Chameleon using the staff and returns all of the stolen kung fu skills to their owners, who return to the Spirit Realm. As Shen and Kai depart, Tai Lung gives his respect to Po and finally acknowledges him as the Dragon Warrior, before taking the Chameleon into the Spirit Realm with him.
        
        Back at the Valley of Peace, Zhen is ready to return to prison, but Po decides to choose her as his successor, much to Shifu's annoyance. Confident of his choice, Po and the Furious Five help train Zhen to become the next Dragon Warrior.

        Mitchell stated that the film's fight scenes reflect advances in both technology and kung fu, and took more influence from anime than previous films in the series. Stunt performers from Marvel films joined production to give the animators moves to study and use in the choreography. The Chameleon was DreamWorks ' most complex character to animate, with a total of 8,130 controls. While most of the animation for the film was provided by DreamWorks Animation Glendale, Jellyfish Pictures, who previously worked with DreamWorks on How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming, Spirit Untamed, The Boss Baby: Family Business, and The Bad Guys handled the additional asset production services using proprietary softwares like Premo and Moonray.

        Kung Fu Panda 4 and The Wild Robot will be the last two films to be made entirely in-house at DreamWorks Animation, as Cartoon Brew reported on October 6, 2023, that the studio would be moving away from producing films in-house in their Glendale campus to rely more heavily on outside studios after 2024.

        In December 2023, Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro, the former of whom also composed for the first three films, were announced to compose the film's score. A cover of Britney Spears' "...Baby One More Time" by Tenacious D is featured in the end credits. The album was released on March 8, 2024, simultaneously with the movie's release, by Back Lot Music.

            By December 2023, it was reported that Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger returned to write the screenplay. In February 2024, Darren Lemke was revealed to have co-written the screenplay. Mitchell described Kung Fu Panda 4 as a love letter to the first film. Despite its connections to previous entries in the series, he wanted the story to stand on its own. When producing the third film, Mitchell felt that Po's character development from the first film was wrapping up due to finally becoming the Dragon Warrior, so he wondered what if another sequel took "all that" away, leading the filmmakers to find some "really great heavy themes" that they felt are important for the modern world. Additionally, Mitchell wanted to evolve Po's character, introduce new characters, and expand the franchise's world, feeling that the film took so long to be produced because the filmmakers wanted a perfect story that could evolve Po by making him learn something to advance to the next level.[19] He described Po as having a black-and-white view of the world and wanted to pair him with a more morally grey character, Zhen. Mitchell also wanted a character who Po can be frustrated by, like how Shifu gets frustrated by him.

            For the Chameleon, Mitchell sought to make her a more brain-than-brawn kind of villain. He went on to say that she is the smartest and most supernatural foe Po has faced. He described Chameleon as a mirror to Po in that both characters were underestimated by society for their bodies, but went on to gain high status. He said, "So Po has become the greatest hero, and now she's the greatest villain". Mitchell felt that one of the things the Kung Fu Panda franchise stands out for, aside from Black's Po, are its villains, so he made sure that the Chameleon could be as formidable as Tai Lung, Lord Shen and General Kai, hence his reasoning to specifically bring the former back into this sequel's story.
